msPurity for Galaxy
========================
Galaxy tools for the Bioconductor R package msPurity. Tools available for assessing precursor ion purity of
LC-MS/MS or DI-M/MS data that has been acquired. Additionally, tools are available to assess LC-MS or DI-MS for
anticipated precursor ion purity to guide a later fragmentation experiment.

A tool for spectral matching functionality is also currently being added.

Warning
------
Proceed with caution these tools are in active development so tools may change! Stable release to Galaxy toolshed coming soon.


Dependencies
------
Dependencies for these Galaxy tools should be handled by CONDA. The most recent version of the msPurity R package can found on channel  [tomnl](https://anaconda.org/tomnl/bioconductor-mspurity) on [anaconda](https://anaconda.org/tomnl/bioconductor-mspurity). Warning this will be a different version of the package compared to the BICONDA bioconductor-mspurity.
